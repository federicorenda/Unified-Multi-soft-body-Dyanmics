# Unified-Multi-soft-body-Dyanmics
A unified formulation which accounts for the dynamics of a general class of aquatic multi-body, soft-structured robots is presented, as described in

F. Renda, F. Giorgio-Serchi, F. Boyer, C. Laschi, J. Dias and L. Seneviratne "A Unified Multi-Soft-Body Dynamic Model for Underwater Soft Robots" The International Journal of Robotics Research, 37(6):648â€“666, 2018. 

Insert your soft robot parameters in:
```
octopus_driver
```
and run it to simulate the dynamics.
The differential equations are implemented in:
```
octopus_derivatives
```
The state vector and other definitions can be found in the paper above.
